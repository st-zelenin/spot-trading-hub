# AI Agent Instructions for Spot Trading Hub

## Mandatory Rules for AI Agents

### 1. No Useless Comments

Do not add unnecessary comments. Code should be self-explanatory through clear naming and structure.

### 2. Always Analyze Before Modifying

Before making any changes, thoroughly examine the current code state as it may have been modified between prompts/sessions. Use search and view tools to understand existing implementations.

### 3. Task Completion Protocol

Once all assigned tasks are completed, do not attempt to run the project or open preview unless explicitly requested by the user.

### 4. Formatting and Lint Errors

Ignore lint errors related to formatting (such as missing newlines, indentation, spacing, etc.) as the user will handle code formatting themselves. Focus only on functional and structural lint errors.
